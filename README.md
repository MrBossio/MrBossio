# Hello world ðŸ‘‹
This Github is created with the purpose of being a notebook in my process to become a good DevOps, and also a kind of guide for new people who wants to learn some topics about development. 

I am Marco, an Informatic Engineer graduated from the "Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica del PerÃº - PUCP", specialized in Cybersecurity, Backend & DevOps.

I also have extensive knowledge of videogames/2D/3D animation by my first degree in Graphic Design. 

# My learning path
I am using https://roadmap.sh/devops as reference to know which languages/technologies/tools I need to learn in my journey to become a good DevOps. 

I will be sharing some projects/demos/pocs related to every topic in the roadmap. Obviously, I will skip some topics and delve into many others depending on the complexity.

let's get started!
