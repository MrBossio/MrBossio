### Hello world 👋
This Github is created with the purpose of being a notebook in my process to become a good DevOps, and also a kind of guide for new people who wants to learn some topics about development. 

I am Marco, an Informatic Engineer graduated from the "Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú - PUCP", specialized in Cybersecurity, Backend & DevOps.

I also have extensive knowledge of videogames/2D/3D animation by my first degree in Graphic Design. 

### About the learning path
I am using https://roadmap.sh/devops as reference to know which languages/technologies/tools I need to learn in my journey to become a good DevOps. 

I will be sharing some projects/demos/PoC related to every topic in the roadmap. Obviously, I will skip some topics and delve into many others depending on the complexity.

Let's get started!

# My path
## Chapter 1: Programming Languages

We are developers, obviously, we need to learn some languages to work in IT. I have worked with many languages and I can recommend two: Python and Java. I also recommend to learn the most commercial framework for every language.

`#Java17` `#Springboot` `#MySQL8`  
Java is the standard of the industry. There is a lot of legacy code based in Java, and also new developments related to this language. Is a must in your list of languages.
- Some projects:
	- **[Air-cargo collapse simulator](https://github.com/MrBossio/parcel-shipments-by-air-cargo-API)**: A program to simulate the daily operations of an Air-cargo company, trying to determine the most efficient algorithm to avoid logistics collapse. Please read carefully the readme file for full details.

`#Python` `#Django` `#PostgreSQL` `#Zappa`  
Python is a great language for a big range of uses, and the main language in Data science. It has very useful libraries for everything.
- Some projects:
	- Running a serverless Django project in AWS Lambda: A example project to run a Django backend using AWS Lambdas, deployed with Zappa.

`#c++` `#csharp` 
C and C++ (and for extension C#) are some of the foundations of our modern society. Is quite difficult to learn C and derivates, but very helpful to become a good developer because you will learn to manage the computer resources at a very low level.
- Some projects:
	- **[LegadoDelSol_v1.0](https://github.com/MrBossio/LegadoDelSol_v1.0)**: Development of a historical fiction video game based on the history of Inca Peru using the User Centered Design framework that generates interest in the activities addressed in the video game. Thesis to opt for my Informatics Engineering Degree.
	- **[ComputerGraphicArts](https://github.com/MrBossio/ComputerGraphicArts)**: 2D and 3D graphic arts using C++ with openGL GLUT library. All the images/videos were written in code.
